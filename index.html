								<h2 class="major">About me</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/IMG_9975.JPG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My name is Tan, Edmund Tan. I am currently 17 but i will turn to 18 this december. I am a Malaysian so I am able to speak a few languages such as, Mandarin, English, Malay and Cantonese. I studied high school and college in Malaysia but I've decided that to attend university in Melbourne. I'm doing Bachelor of Technology in RMIT and this is my first year. My hobbies are playing badminton and playing cardgames(Magic The Gathering, Death angel, etc)</p>
								<h1> Personal profile </h1>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The results of the three tests were a general idea of my personality, learning style and creativity. I would say the results were true but not entirely. This is because our personality, creativity and learning style might change as we grow older. There are also other factors that might change it. For example: the environment we are in, the people around us, etc.</p>
								<p>I think that these results may have a positive influence on my behavior on the team. It can be observed from the Myers-Briggs test that I am more extroverted, which means I can communicate easily and effectively in a team. Other than that, the second test shows that I am a tactile learner. This shows that I learn things by touching and doing, this will increase the interaction between me and the team which leads to an increase in teamwork. The last test states that I am open to creativity. This shows that I am good in problem solving and I won’t restrict innovative solutions.</p>
								<p>When working, we might be placed into teams. So, when forming a team I think we should take a few things into account. Firstly, A much more creative person is required because the more creative person, the better and my creativeness isn’t that high, only slightly above average. Other than that, I think we need people that can work in a group without arguing. This will allow the group to function as one and have a higher efficiency. Lastly, a team leader with good judgment skills is required to delegate the task, guide the group on the right track and makes the right choices.</p>

						<!-- Interest in IT -->
							<article id="interest">
								<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>IT has become a very wide topic as technology is advancing rapidly. Although all IT topics are interesting, I will only mention two as they are my favorites. The first one is cloud computing because it allows us to store and access data in a virtual one instead of a physical object. The second one is robotics. Robotics has changed our lifestyles drastically by decreasing the workload of humans. Both Cloud computing and robotic has made our daily lives easier.</p>
								<p>My interest in IT started to develop when I got my first ever smartphone, it was also the time where I became much more aware of IT. Another reason that I became interested was because of my father. He would play tinker with the computer and his phone when I was younger and that made me interested in IT.</p>
								<p>I chose to study in RMIT because it is one of the leading universities in Melbourne and ranked among the best universities for technology. It is also because RMIT provides a variety of amazing facilities which created the perfect optimal studying environment for a student. During my studies, I hope that I will be able to learn and develop skills which will be able to aid me in the future. For example: social skills, teamwork skills, team leading skills, programming, cloud computing, etc.</p>

						<!-- Ideal Job -->
							<article id="job">
								<h2 class="major">Ideal job</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My ideal job must be a job that has opportunities for growth and further develops my skills. It must also meet the requirement where the pay is able to satisfy my needs and wants. Other than that, I want a job with flexible working hours so that my life will be balance between working and playing. The link (https://www.seek.com.au/job/36724644?type=standard) is where i found a job that is similar to my ideal job.</p>
								<p>I chose this job application because it has a few benefits which caught my eye and is the one closest to my ideal job compared to the rest. This job will allow me to have a flexible working hour with an average amount of pay. In the job specification, it stated that I will be working in a team. This is an interesting point as the workload can be shared amongst the group and also increases the efficiency of everyone. Furthermore, training from professionals will be provided the company. This will allow me to further polish my skills. </p>
								<p>As a web designer, one must have a specific set of skills and a huge space for creativity. I must have the knowledge on how to use coding software such as HTML because it will be used to create the “body” of the website. I will also need to know UX/UI to make the website user friendly. Lastly, knowledge on Photoshop is also needed as it will make the website pleasing and astatic. As for experience, I personally think that any amount of experience is fine as long as I am able to produce good websites.</p>
								<p>I’m a student studying Bachelor of technology in RMIT and I took the course introduction to information technology, introduction to programming, user centered design and play society. Because of these courses, I already have the basics in programming, UX/UI and knowledge in HTML software. However, I have no experience in web designing and the skills that I currently have will not be sufficient to meet the requirements.</p>
								<p>To further develop my current skills, I will have to take online courses and also spend extra hours outside of universities reading books relevant to it. I will have to do more activities that can help me increase my creativity. Other than that, I will have to learn more skills such as Photoshop, coding using other software, etc. to meet the requirements.</p>

						<!-- Project ideas -->
							<article id="ideas">
								<h2 class="major">Project ideas</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>IT is a broad subject with a variety of topics so naturally, there will be a lot of project ideas. I personally think that a tutor finding app is an interesting yet suitable project for this modern era. This project will be an app that helps students from different level of education starting from high school to PhD to find the suitable tutor for a subject. In general, the students can go onto the app and select their level of education and the subject. After that, a list of tutors will appear, and the students will be able to choose the most appealing one to tutor them.</p>
								<p>As time passes the world population is growing steadily from 7,550,262,101 in July 1, 2017 to 7,632,819,325 in July 1, 2018. Over the pass ten years the population is constantly increasing by about 1.09% per year. This will also mean that there will be more students attending schools, college and universities. There are many factors affecting the student’s risk of dropping out, including low levels of school engagement, low parental education, etc. With student dropping out, their future job will be limited as they lack the credentials and skills. However, this problem can be solved if the tutor finding app is developed. The students will then be able to find tutors with qualification to help them and increases their school performances.</p>
								<p>As mentioned above, the tutor finding app in an application which helps students in finding a tutor to teach and help them in their studies. Other than that, it is also an app that helps people with good qualifications earn money. It is also an opportunity for students to get experience in teaching if they ever want to be a teacher or lecturer. Firstly, the app will require the user to create an account using their email.  The user can create a student account or a tutor account depending on what they are using it for. The users will then be asked for their personal details such as, name, age, education, occupation, email and contact number. For those who created a tutor account will then need to create a profile showing their name, qualifications, educations, choice of subject that they are able to teach and teaching method (online, face to face or both). The app will then display the tutor’s information under the subjects that they offer. The users with student account will then select the subjects that they want, and a list of tutors will appear for them to choose. After choosing the desired tutor, a message will be sent to the tutor by the system asking them whether they are willing to accept the student or not. If the tutor clicks yes, the message “Congrats, the tutor accepted your request.” After this the student will be able to chat with the tutor about the date of the tuition, duration of the tuition, etc. On the other hand, if the tutor clicked no, the message “Sorry, please choose another tutor.” will be sent to the student. The app will generate the price of the tuition and show it both the tutor and student so that the tutor won’t overcharge, and student won’t pay lesser than it should be. However, the price for each tuition will be different because of the qualifications of the tutor, the subject that they are teaching, the duration of the tuition and the level of education. The app will take everything into account and generate a reasonable price for the tuition. A rating and review system will also be implemented into the app, it will act as an indicator of quality. Students will be able to leave a rating or a review on the tutor after the tuition. If the tutor gets good rating and review, they will be placed under the recommended section where it is easier for students to spot. Although it is a free app, we will still make some profit from it. Since the app records everything, we will know the amount of tuition each tutor is giving. Every month, we will send a document to tutors that did tuition a payment email. Inside the email will be all the tuition that was done by the tutor and the amount of money they earn, from there a small percentage will be deducted. That small amount is the amount that the tutor should pay to us. If the tutor doesn’t pay that amount, their account will be suspended and will eventually be ban.</p>
								<p>Because the project is an app, I will require a programming software. However, the programming software must be able to run on both IOS and Android platforms. So, Java plus C is to develop apps that can run on Android platforms and IOS relies on Objective-C and Swift. Photoshop will be needed as well to create designs for the app icon and the interior of the app. As for hardware, a laptop is needed to run the programming software and photoshop. Since the app is designed to run on both IOS and Android platforms, a phone that runs on IOS and another that runs on android is required to do test runs of the app. </p>
								<p>I will need to know how to use programming software such as Java plus C, Objective-C and Swift to code for the app. Being able to photoshop will also help as it is needed to design the interior and the icons. Other than that, I need to know how to use both Android phones and IOS phones. To make the app user friendly, I must have the knowledge of UX or UI, or else only few people will be able to use the app I developed.</p>
								<p>If this project is successful and the app is developed, the grades of students of the world will be higher. It will also help those people that is applying for a teaching job but requires some experience. Other than that, it creates part time jobs for people that are trying to earn more money. In conclusion, this app will help increase the country’s education level and economy by creating more jobs and boosting the education of the students. It is because education is a vital source to maintain and boost our economic system as having highly skilled workers varied in different professions will create a diverse workforce. </p>
